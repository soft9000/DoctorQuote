## Two Editions

Here is the free version of "Doctor Quote."

Like you, I too have to earn a living in this world. 

So whilst the free version has many quotations, I've another version of Doctor Quote... One that has EVERY quotation that I've ever collected.

## Where To Get It All?

We will be adding a link (probably to a PayPal store) to allow anyone interested to help me continue *sharing* the quote-collection quest with others. 

In the mean time, feel free to enjoy "Doctor Quote - Free"! (*)

(*) p.s: *This classic 32 bit Windows program works fine on Linux, as well!* 

To run on every version of Windows ever created, as well as Linux, simply:

1.) Download the zip archive

2.) Un-zip the archive to a new folder

3.) Change directory to the new folder and

4.) Run [DoctorQuote.exe](https://github.com/soft9000/DoctorQuote/blob/master/DoctorQuote32/DoctorQuoteFree.zip) from that new folder, as well!



To share, is to care?
